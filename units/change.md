# Change
A difference in the past and the present of some part of existence.

---

Some part of existence means, ultimately:

- An [*entity*](./entity.md)
- A set of entities in some relationship


---

The terms "difference", "past", "present" are defined ostensively, with "past" and "present" being defined by pointing to the relationship between one’s awareness in the moment and one’s memory, (memory being retained awareness). Hence, change not only applies to intrinsic changes (change in an entity’s own features) but also relational changes (e.g. relative spatial movement/repositioning). Needless to say, being a part of existence, a particular change has a particular identity.

**SIDE NOTE**: _In speaking of "past" and "present", I am speaking not of_ [*time*](./time.md) _as such but of the direct awareness of change; the concept of time comes from this awareness. Hence, note that time is not an ineffable construct; like any measurement, it relates things in reality through observations of the facts, and thus, the properties of things in reality reflect on measured time (see the linked entry on time for more clarity)._
