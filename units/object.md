# Object
A unit with independent existence:

- An entity is the fundamental kind of object
- An object also refers to systems/representations of entities

## Object-Oriented Programming
**Design-level**:

A well-defined [*representation*](./representation.md) of a functional unit.

**Implementation level**:

Data structure that stores and gives access to:

- Data or references to data
- The procedures designed to operate on these data

---

Some key points about objects:

- Executes a method when it receives a [*request*](./request.md#programming) from a client
- Requests are the only way to make an object execute a method
- Methods are the only way to change an object's state

Due to these constraints, an object's attributes and methods are [*encapsulated*](./encapsulation.md).
