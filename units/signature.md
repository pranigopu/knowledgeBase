# Signature
That which succinctly distinguishes a unit in a given context.

**NOTE**: _The distinguishing factor(s) need not be essentials._

# Object-Oriented Programming
The combination of a [*method*](./method.md)'s:

- Name
- Parameters (if any)
- Return value (if any)

---

A signature is always of a method.
