# Time
The [*measure*](./measure) of [*change*](./change).

---

Note that [*time*](./time.md) is a concept derived from change, since time is, in essence, a measure of change, i.e. a relationship between a change and a unit of change; a unit of change is a perceptually-grasped change (or a change reducible to perceptually grasped change) that recurs and whose recurrences are constantly spaced in memory.
